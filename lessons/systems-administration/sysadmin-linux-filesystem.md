# Lesson
## Section 1
The Linux file system is a tree hierarchy that starts with the folder at the very base of the tree: `/`.  Perhaps somewhat confusingly, this directory is called the `root` directory, not to be confused with the home folder for the `root` user located at `/root`.  In fact the folder `/root` is one of many other folders in the `/` directory.  You can identify these folders because they immediately follow the `/` in an `absolute path`.  A non-comprehensive list and short description of these folders that you find on almost every major Linux distribution are as follows:  
  
```
/home - User home directories (and user configuration files) are kept here.
/etc  - Contains a wide amount of configuration files for the operating system.
/bin  - Contains most binaries (programs) that are deemed critical for the system to operate.
/usr  -	Binaries/programs for users (as opposed to the system) are in here.  Usually read-only.
/opt  - Optional or add-on programs and software packages.
/var  - Variable data files, such as logs and web pages.
/dev  - Device files that are use to interact with physical hardware.
/tmp  - Temporary files.  The system usually deletes everything in this folder when it is restarted.
